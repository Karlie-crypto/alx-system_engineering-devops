    0. What is my PID
        0-what-is-my-pid: Bash script that displays its own PID.

    1. List your processes
        1-list_your_processes: Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.
        Shows all processes for all users, including those not featuring a TTY.
        Processes are displayed in a user-oriented hierarchy.

    2. Show your Bash PID
        2-show_your_bash_pid: Bash script that displays lines containing the bash keyword based on the script defined in 1-list_your_processes.

    3. Show your Bash PID made easy
        3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy: Bash script that displays the PID along with the process name of processes who name contains the word bash.

    4. To infinity and beyond
        4-to_infinity_and_beyond: Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely with a sleep 2 in between each iteration.

    5. Don't stop me now!
        5-dont_stop_me_now: Bash script that kills the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using kill.

    6. Stop me if you can
        6-stop_me_if_you_can: Bash script that kills the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using pkill.

    7. Highlander
        7-highlander: Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely with a sleep 2 in between each iteration.
        Displays I am invincible!!! upon receiving a SIGTERM signal.

    8. Beheaded process
        8-beheaded_process: Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

    9. Process and PID file
        100-process_and_pid_file: Bash script that creates the file /var/run/holbertonscript.pid containing its PID and displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.
        Displays I hate the kill command upon receiving a SIGTERM signal.
        Displays Y U no love me?! upon receiving a SIGINT signal.
        Deletes the file /var/run/holbertonscript.pid and terminates itself upon receiving the SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal.

    10. Manage my process
        manage_my_process: Bash script that writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process indefinitely.
            Sleeps two seconds in between each write.
        101-manage_my_process: Bash script that manages the manage_my_process script.
        When passed the argument start:
            Starts manage_my_process.
            Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid.
            Displays manage_my_process started.
        When passed the argument stop:
            Stops manage_my_process.
            Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid.
            Displays manage_my_process stopped.
        When passed the argument restart:
            Stops manage_my_process.
            Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid.
            Starts manage_my_process.
            Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid.
            Displays manage_my_process started.
        Otherwise, displays Usage: manage_my_process {start|stop|restart}.

    11. Zombie
        102-zombie.c: C program that creates five zombie processes.
        For every zombie created, displays Zombie process created, PID: <ZOMBIE_PID>.
